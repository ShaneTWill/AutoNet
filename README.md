# AutoNet

This is a project that I am working on for the automated creation of neural network models using Tensorflow. The current implimentation works for classification and regression. In the future I hope to be making the code compatable for both Windows and (*)nix systems. The train function is also subject to change soon. This code is still actively in development and the structure is not definite. For example at the moment the file creation method asks for a model name. This could cause problems and that ability will most likely be depricated.
